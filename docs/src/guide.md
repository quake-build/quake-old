# Guide

This chapter gives a fairly comprehensive tour of quake's features.
It assumes no prior knowledge of [nushell](https://nushell.sh), but does assume the reader has at least some familiarity with basic scripting and shell usage.

If you want to follow along with any examples, you should first [install quake](./installation.md).
